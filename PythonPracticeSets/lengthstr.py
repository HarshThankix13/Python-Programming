# Write a Python program to find the length of a string using a variable.
# String
my_string = "Hello, World!"

# Initialize the length variable with 0
length = 0

# Iterate through each character in the string
for char in my_string:
    # Increment the length variable
    length += 1

# Display the length of the string
print("Length of the string:", length)
