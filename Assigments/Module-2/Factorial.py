In Python, the `f` in `print(f"Hello, My name is {name} and I'm {age} years old.")` is used to create an f-string,
which is a way to format strings that was introduced in Python 3.6Â¹. F-strings provide a concise and convenient way to embed expressions inside string literals for formattingÂ².
The expressions inside the curly braces `{}` are evaluated at runtime and their values are inserted into the stringÂ³.

F-strings are faster, more readable, more concise, and less prone to error than other ways of formatting stringsÂ¹. They can be used to format strings in a more elegant and straightforward way than using the `format()` 
method or other string formatting mechanismsÂ¹. Is there anything else you would like to know? ğŸ˜Š
